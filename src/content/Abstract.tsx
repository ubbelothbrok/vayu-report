          This report presents an end-to-end flight control stack developed on top of the hardware-agnostic infrastructure, 
          NavHAL and VAIOS. In an era of rapid technological advancement, the demand for autonomous systems has increased 
          significantly. Autonomous systems—capable of operating independently, making decisions without human intervention—represent 
          a crucial direction for the future.

          We aim to contribute to this evolving domain by focusing on the foundational aspects of flight control systems. 
          We believe that progress in autonomy cannot be decoupled from the underlying low-level mechanisms of flight control stacks. 
          To meet emerging requirements, it is essential to design and adapt these low-level systems with precision and efficiency.

          Existing open-source architectures often introduce unnecessary complexity due to their broad scope and general-purpose design. 
          In this project, <strong>Vayu</strong>, we propose a streamlined and efficient base layer tailored for high-performance 
          autonomous aerial systems. Our approach emphasizes modularity, efficiency, and adaptability, providing a robust foundation 
          for future developments in autonomous flight.
